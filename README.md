👀 I'm soon to be a post-graduate with an MSc in Data Science from The University of Bristol, United Kingdom (2021-2022). I'm an enthusiastic individual with a passion for working with vast amounts of data and developing models that will help grow your company.

💪 I intend to apply the following skills I have nurtured and developed through my Master's degree to solve real-world problems:
- Programming Languages: Python, R, SQL 
- Tools: Git, Tableau, Power BI, Excel, MATLAB, LaTeX
- Hard skills: Machine Learning, Data Analytics, Natural Language Processing and Amazon Web Services
- Soft Skills: Teamwork, Communication, Leadership 

🌱 As a post-graduate in Data Science, I'm looking for intellectually exciting projects to help me advance my abilities in Data Engineering, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Natural Language Processing.
